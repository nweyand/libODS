# libODS
A minimalistic library for reading and writing data to and from ODS (Open Document Spreadsheet) files. Differing licensing for compatibility with your project can be arranged. :)


At the moment, the following is supported:
• Opening ODS files
• Converting spreadsheet coordinates: A1 ⇔ (0;0)
• Reading the content of single cells from an opened file

The following features are currently still missing:
• Writing to or saving ODS files
• Accessing so called repeated cells and rows
